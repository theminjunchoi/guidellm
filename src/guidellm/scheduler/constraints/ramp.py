"""
Saturation detection and peak measurement for request rate ramps.

A server keeping up with a ramp completes requests at the rate they were sent,
one request latency later. Once it saturates, completions fall short of what
was sent and requests start piling up. This constraint detects that shortfall,
stops sending, and measures the completion rate while the server works through
the requests it already has, which is when it runs at full capacity.

    Detect when a rate ramp saturates the server and measure its peak.

    While ramping, compares the requests completed over the last
    ``window_seconds`` with the requests sent over the same length of time one
    measured latency earlier. When completions fall more than ``shortfall``
    below that, the server is saturated: queuing stops, and requests already
    sent keep running for ``drain_latencies`` request latencies before local
    processing stops too. The peak is the highest completion rate over any
    ``window_seconds`` window up to that point.

        constraint = RampSaturationConstraint(window_seconds=8.0)
